## Features

- Edit existing tasks  
- Delete tasks  
- Data is saved in LocalStorage, so tasks remain even after closing the browser

2. Open the project folder in VS Code or any editor.  
3. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code (recommended).  
4. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".  
5. The app will open in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`.  

## Data Storage
